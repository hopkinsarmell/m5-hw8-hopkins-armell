## Issues
1. My messages stopped populating out of nowhere after working successfully days prior. With help, I was able to determine I needed to change innerHTML to textContent. It would not change occasionally, but I figured that was due to it selecting the same message at random.
3. I also found it challenging to get the styling in sync with some of the mockups due to my screen's limitations. I ultimately shrunk my window and adjusted the responsive slider in Devtools to get to the larger screen sizes. I hope this translates well to actual larger screens.

## Resources
1. I viewed random games on CodePen to see how certain features were coded to get a better understanding of how things work by changing parts to see what would impact what.
2. [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34532167/generate-and-display-random-message-javascript) answer on Stackoverflow.com was helpful to understand Math random better. However, it was also where I determined to use innerHTML instead of textContent, which caused one of my issues.
